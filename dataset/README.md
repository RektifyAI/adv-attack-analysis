# Sena Exploratory Attack Library(SEAL) dataset

The Sena Exploratory Attack Library(SEAL) dataset is the end point to data curation tasks. The vision for the dataset is to become an NFT so that others that use S.E.A.L. will have co-ownership Sena data. By way of smart contracts we can prove the provenance of SEAL data. 

Data visualizations created from SEAL data will be considered SEAL artifacts which will also become NFTs. Sena aims to use SEAL beyond conducting multi-variate statistical analysis to make inferences. Analysts' creativity is accepted and strongly promoted as a means create expression with data beyond the domains of math and science.

The SEAL risk dashboard comprises of all the token investments Sena users have on their wallet of choice.
