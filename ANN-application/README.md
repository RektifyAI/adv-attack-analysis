# ANN applications for detecting vulnerabilities on blockchain-based products

The ANN repo highlights case-uses of supervised learning to gradient descent, linear regression, classifcation, and predictive models with the REAL API, along with extracting relevant metadata from hack events in Web3. Through using advanced data science techniques, we explore the feasibility of utilizing artificial neural networks (ANNs) for measuring risk assessment in vulnerabilities. 

Using REAL API data is key. In a 2022 survey, we found that 96% of respondents would like to be notified of an attack before it happens, the other 4% were not opposed, so by enabling projects to be cognizant of present vulnerabilities we can directly impact the health of their blockchains and the happiness of their consumers.

Rektify AI uses AI/ML to analyze attacks on any blockchain-based cryptocurrency. By way of ANNs we can analyze attack specific data in the decentralized finance domain.
