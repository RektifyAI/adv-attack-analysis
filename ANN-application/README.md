# Artificial Neural Network application for analyzing risk in DeFi

Sena implements machine learning techniques such as supervised learning to created regression, classifcation, and predictive models with the S.E.A.L. dataset along with relevant metadata. Through using AI/ML, Sena will explore the feasibility of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for risk assessment in predicting possible attacks using S.E.A.L. data. Sena is the first DeFi protocol to using AI/ML to analyze attack data.
