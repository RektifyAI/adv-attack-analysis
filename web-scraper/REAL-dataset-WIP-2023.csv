Users who have traded on this market should cancel their authorization as soon as possible. According to SlowMist analysis, only the sell order is checked in the fillSellOrder function of the market contract, and the buyer's buy order is not checked. Therefore, the attacker first creates an arbitrary NFT contract, calls the fillSellOrder function to generate a sell order, and passes the buyer parameter as the victim's address and the paymentERC20 parameter as the token address to be stolen, then the user who is authorized to the market contract can be transferred. Tokens are transferred for profit."
XCarnival,,06/26/2022,"1,620 ETH",Contract vulnerabilities,,,"The NFT liquidity solver XCarnival was attacked, the hacker made a profit of 3,087 ETH (about 3.8 million US dollars), and the hacker has returned 1,467 ETH after the negotiation. The core of this vulnerability is that when borrowing, there is no judgment on whether the NFT in the order has been withdrawn."

According to the analysis of SlowMist MistTrack, the attackers made more than 100 million US dollars, including 11 ERC20 tokens, 13,100 ETH, 5,000 BNB and 640,000 BUSD. On the 26th, Harmony founder Stephen Tse said on Twitter that Horizon was attacked not because of a smart contract vulnerability, but because of a private key leak. Although Harmony stored the private keys encrypted, the attacker decrypted some of them and signed some unauthorized transactions. At present, Harmony has migrated Horizon's verification authority on the Ethereum side to 4/5 multi-signature."

LV PLUS claims to be affiliated with the ""LV Metaverse"", and the main reason for the loss, which is defined as a Rug Pull, is that the LV PLUS contract deployer sent tokens to certain wallets - these wallet addresses subsequently sold the project's tokens, causing the project's market to crash ."
whaleswap.finance,,06/21/2022,5946 BUSD+5964 USDT,K value verification vulnerability,,,"The whaleswap.finance project was attacked, and at least 5946 BUSD and 5964 USDT were lost. The reason may be that there is a problem with the K value verification of the whaleswap.finance Pair contract. Whenever the user exchanges, there is a problem with the parameter magnitude passed in the K value verification, which causes the K value verification to fail. The attacker first borrows a BSC-USD through a flash loan, and then returns the flash loan when the K value verification parameter is on the order of 10000^4. The parameter verification level used in the K value verification is 10000^2, which causes the K verification to fail."

Optimism,,06/09/2022,"2,000,000 OP",Multi-signature address transfer vulnerability,,,"Optimism and Wintermute both released announcements, disclosing to the community a loss of 20 million OP tokens. At the time of the release of OP tokens, Optimism entrusted Wintermute to provide liquidity services for OP in the secondary market. As part of the agreement, Optimism will provide Wintermute with 20 million OP tokens. To receive the tokens, Wintermute gave Optimism a multi-signature address, to which Optimism transferred 20 million OPs after Optimism test sent two transactions and Wintermute confirmed it was correct. After Optimism transferred the coins, Wintermute found that they had no way to control these coins, because the multi-signature addresses they provided were only deployed on the Ethereum mainnet for the time being and have not yet been deployed to the Optimism network. To gain control of these tokens, Wintermute immediately initiated remediation operations. However, attackers have already noticed this vulnerability and deployed multi-signature to this address on the Optimism network before Wintermute, successfully controlling the 20 million tokens. At present, the Optimism hacker has returned 17 million OP tokens and transferred 1 million OP to the Vitalik address, and Vitalik has returned the funds."

When manipulating with real large funds, the attacker would need to wait at least until the second block to see the price of the currency react. Due to the existence of TWAP, the attacker usually needs to wait a few more minutes for the price to become more obvious. For this attack, the attackers did exactly that. However, embarrassingly, a suspected arbitrage robot appeared in the second block. This address immediately converted a large amount of BED into ETH in the second block, maintaining the stability of the original currency price.

At first he didn't even know that the money came from Tronbank. Some people in the community suggested that wojak return the money to the Tronbank developers, but wojak believes that this is not his problem. Developers should write test examples, do audits, and at least run some formal verifications (obviously they didn’t do anything). He is willing to return the money intact to every investor in Tronbank, not the developer of the project. Based on the available information, it is still too early to conclude that ""the developer placed a backdoor in the contract"".

Whenever the user exchanges, there is a problem with the parameter magnitude passed in the K value verification, which causes the K value verification to fail. The attacker first borrows a BSC-USD through a flash loan, and then returns the flash loan when the K value verification parameter is on the order of 10000^4.
